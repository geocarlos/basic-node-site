# Very simple site with Node http module

This is just not a way one would work. This is just intended to understand Node with only its internal http module, without a framework, such as Express. 

In real projects, I use Express :)

## For beginners who might want to try this:

Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/geocarlos/basic-node-site.git`.

CD into the directory: `cd basic-node-site`.

Run server with Node: `node server`.

Point your browser to "http://localhost:3001" to view the simple site.

Try to figure it out and make improvements :)
